## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries using `clamp()` for responsiveness
- Accessibility enhancements (e.g., visually hidden headings)

### What I learned

- Use `clamp()` to make elements adapt to screen width
- Align elements responsively between breakpoints using media queries
- Apply BEM naming convention for clean CSS structure
- Use accessibility techniques like visually hidden headings

### Continued development

Areas I want to focus on in future projects:

- More advanced layouts using CSS Grid
- Improving accessibility (ARIA roles, semantic structure)
- Writing cleaner, more reusable CSS

### Useful resources

- [CSS Clamp Explained – Josh W Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/clamp/) – Helped me understand how to use `clamp()` effectively
- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox) – My go-to guide for layout
